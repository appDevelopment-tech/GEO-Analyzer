## GUEST POST PITCH
Subject: Article idea: How AI is changing search (and what marketers should do)

Hi [Name],

I've been following [Publication] and loved your recent piece on [Article Title]—great insights on [Specific Point].

I'd like to contribute an article on "GEO vs AEO: The Simple Guide Marketers Need to Know."

This is a hot topic right now—Reddit's r/SEO and r/DigitalMarketing communities are asking these questions daily, but there's genuine confusion about the terminology and how to actually implement it.

What the article would cover:
- Simple explanation of GEO vs AEO (no jargon)
- Practical checklist marketers can implement today
- Real data on what makes AI engines cite certain sources
- Free tools for measuring AI recommendation readiness

I run GeoAnalyzer (geoanalyzer.netlify.app), a free tool that helps websites optimize for AI recommendations from ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. We've analyzed 1,000+ websites, so I have hands-on data and insights to share.

Would you be interested in this piece? Happy to adjust the angle to better fit your audience.

Best,
