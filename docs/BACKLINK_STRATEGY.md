Hi [Name],

I've been following [Publication] and loved your recent piece on [Topic].

I'd like to contribute an article on "GEO vs AEO: The Simple Guide Marketers Need."
This is a hot topic—Reddit's SEO communities are asking these questions daily,
but there's confusion about terminology and implementation.

The article would cover:
- Simple explanation of GEO vs AEO (what marketers need to know)
- Practical checklist for getting started
- Real examples of brands winning in AI search
- Tools for measuring AI recommendation readiness

I run GeoAnalyzer, a free tool that helps websites optimize for AI recommendations,
so I have hands-on experience and data to share.

Hi [Name],

I found your resource page [URL] while researching AI marketing tools—really
comprehensive list!

I noticed you don't have any GEO/AEO optimization tools listed. GeoAnalyzer is
a free tool that helps websites optimize for ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini citations.
It's used by [X] marketers and has been featured in [Y].

Would you consider adding it? Here's a quick description:

"GeoAnalyzer - Free tool to check if your website is optimized for AI recommendations
from ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Get your GEO score in 60 seconds."

Either way, hope this helps! The page is a great resource.

Hi [Name],

I was reading your article on [Topic] and found it really helpful—until I hit
a broken link.

I actually wrote a guide covering this same topic: [Our URL]. It covers [brief

If you think it would be valuable to your readers, would you consider updating
